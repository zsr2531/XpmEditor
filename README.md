# XpmEditor
A quick and dirty web based editor for creating X PixMap icons.

## What the heck is this?
I needed a little helper tool to make XPM icons to use with my status bar.

## Features
- Color picker
- Color history
- Pixel based editor
- Code generation for the icon

## Missing features
- Support for more characters per icon (probably not going to be implemented).
- You can only draw 1 pixel at a time, no floodfill (paint bucket tool) or anything like that.
- Cannot import from existing XPM code. (maybe going to be implemented? we'll see).
